 maneuverability and good fuel efficiency. It is equipped with an air-cooled 4-stroke
 113cc engine with CVT (Continuous variable transmission) that boasts excellent

speed range, a power output characterized by smooth start-up acceleration and quick 
passing acceleration and more. <br/><br/>The body has fresh, innovative styling based
 on a design concept of being “Sophisticated & Dynamic,” and is full of fine touches 
that women will appreciate, like a seat designed with easy leg reach to the ground 
and ease of mounting in mind, ample storage space and easy to operate center and 
side stands.
