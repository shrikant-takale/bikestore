<p class="text">The 153cc SZ-R is a modern &amp; sporty version of 
SZ-X which is a powerful, comfortable and stylish commuter. The muscular SZ-R is 
targeted at commuter customers with their sports-oriented interests and is designed 
to create the sensation of &ldquo;High Speed&rdquo;. The bike comes with front 
disc brake, tachometer and has tank protector added to the fuel tank to make it appear
 even larger. Furthermore, the shroud of the standard SZ-X model is replaced by an 
aerodynamic spoiler that extends out boldly and is given the same silver coloring as
 the side covers. The bike also has clear lens flasher, colored handle grip end bar, 
painted muffler end caps along with special graphics.
