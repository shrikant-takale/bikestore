<p class="mt20">The Fazer, gets its DNA from the global Fazer series known for 
their sports touring, awesome looks. It has a &ldquo;Look-at-me&rdquo; appeal 
with the <span class="mt-bold"> triple macho design concept</span> giving it a
 concentrated form with excellent ergonomics. It has the beautifully contoured 
<span class="mt-bold">color &ndash; coordinated aerodynamic cowling </span>to 
keep the wind blast at bay. With its comfortable riding position and seat the rider 
can enjoy a week end getaway or head off on a touring holiday.  </p>
<p class="mt20">Just like FZ16 and FZ-S, Fazer carries the Monocross suspension 
to ensure agile running performance and handling. The placement of this 
model&rsquo;s <span class="mt-bold"> &lsquo;MidShip Muffler&rsquo;</span>
toward the center of the machine gives it a good concentration of mass, exhaust 
efficiency and handling. Fazer has the <span class="mt-bold">&ldquo;140/60-17&rdquo;</span>
size rear radial tyre with a 60% aspect ratio contributes to better grip and handling stability.</p>
<p class="mt20">Fazer will be available in four colors -  Midnight Black, Lava 
Red, Competition White and Black Cyber Green.</p>
