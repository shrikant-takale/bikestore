<tr><td><h2>VMAX the Legend continues&hellip;</h2>
<p class="text mt20">During the late 90&rsquo;s Yamaha&rsquo;s VMAX project team started to work on the rebirth of a
legend. The team understand just how special the original VMAX is to its owners &ndash; as
well as those fans who admired the bike without ever riding one. The project team
identified a set of four goals that would enable them to create a worthy successor to the
legendary original model.</p>
<p class="text mt20">Awesome acceleration feeling together with strong performance<br>
Distinctive, precise and sharp handling<br>
A sophisticated chassis with unique bodywork</p>
<p class="text mt20">With these main aims in mind, the development team have created an all-new powerful
state-of-the-art 1,679cc V4 engine providing 200 PS and 166.8 Nm of torque combined
with Yamaha&rsquo;s finest and latest electronic engine control technology such as YCC-I and
YCC-T. We&rsquo;ve also created an all-new low-profile diamond-type frame, which uses the
engine as a stressed member in order to deliver the right balance of rigidity, which
makes for excellent straight line stability &ndash; together with precise and sharp levels of
cornering. All packed in a head-turning and forceful appearance.</p>
<p class="text mt20">Owners of the original model &ndash; as well as newcomers to the VMAX world &ndash; can be sure
that the new VMAX delivers an unforgettable combination of innovation and
acceleration.</p>
<p class="text mt20">The new VMAX stays true to the philosophy of the genuine hot-rod. Imagine yourself
gripping the drag bars and feeling the mega-wide 200/50 R18 rear tyre transfer all the
V4&rsquo;s incredible 200 PS and 166.8 Nm of throbbing torque to the ground &ndash; it&rsquo;s got to the
ultimate adrenaline ride. We are proud to say the VMAX is back!</p></td></tr></table>
