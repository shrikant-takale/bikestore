<tr><td><h2>YZF-R1 - State-of-the art race technology</h2>
<p class="text">Yamaha R1 represents a paradigm shift in technology, performance and controllability among litre class sport bikes. The R1 has been designed to be the &ldquo;Ultimate Cornering Master 1000&rdquo; of the open super sport class. Inspired by Yamaha&rsquo;s M1 MotoGP race bike, this latest generation 998cc R1 features a crossplane crankshaft design with an uneven firing order to provide outstanding yet easy to control torque and an exceptionally linear throttle feel never experienced before. But there is far more to R1 than just a revolutionary engine.</p>
<p class="text">Crossplane crankshaft technology proven in victory after victory on MotoGP&reg; machines provides a high-tech uneven firing interval. Unlike typical inline-four engine design, where the two outer and two inner pistons move together in pairs with 180&deg; intervals, the crossplane crankshaft has each connecting rod 90&deg; with a unique firing order of 270&deg; &ndash; 180&deg; &ndash; 90&deg; &ndash; 180&deg;. This overcomes the inherent fluctuations in inertial torque during each engine revolution, and the accompanying peaky torque characteristics. Instead, combustion torque continues to build, giving the rider more linear throttle response with awesome power and traction out of the corners. </p>
<p class="text">This R1 keeps all the technological superiorities developed for its predecessor: YCC-T&trade; (Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle) is MotoGP&reg; inspired fly-by-wire technology used to deliver instant throttle response. YCC-I&reg; is Yamaha Chip Controlled Intake which is a variable intake system that broadens the spread of power. The fuel injection system provides optimum air/fuel mixtures for maximum power and smooth throttle response.  </p>
<p class="text">The R1 features Yamaha D-MODE (or drive mode) with rider-selectable throttle control maps to program YCC-T performance characteristics for riding conditions.  </p>
<p class="text">Yamaha believes that developing motorcycles is both a technological and an artistic endeavor. It pursues a level of performance that transcends mere specifications. The goal is to produce technologically superior motorcycles that should have a deep and intangible emotional appeal. It is what defines the company and this is what we call the &ldquo;Art of Engineering".  </p>
